# Mindexer

## Overview

This is a command line utility that reads in a directory and writes up a markdown (.md) file of the full directory.
The file is just a bulleted list of every file and directory with all entries hyperlinked. Hyperlinks are meant to be 
compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Usage

> Mindexer -r "path to folder to index" -o "path to output file"
